Using Web Design Principles to Create a Usable and Aesthetically Pleasing Natural History Timeline Webpage

Julian Grace-Martin

The software will consist of a website built with HTML and CSS for visuals and have a backend that is using flask in Python to support more interactive features with the user. The website will show a timeline starting back from when the first evidence of life was found to the present. The website allows the user to select eras to display on the timelines and events to show above the timeline to compare to one another from check-box menus. The user can select any number of these from the three different menus before submitting them all at once, and then can deselect those and/or select other ones to display. The timeline and the events will be created as HTML objects on the page with heavy CSS styling. There will only be one page in the website, but depending on which items the user selects the page will have to display different information. The Python will be used to change what's being displayed based on what the user selects.
The code consists of an HTML layout file that is a template for any webpage on the site, an index.html file with the main webpage structures, a CSS file to apply to the HTML, and an app.py file to render the file and allow dynamic changes on the website.
The study implemented design principles found to be aesthetically pleasing or improve the usability of websites which included some such as alignment, whitespace, use of colors, and feedback to the user (visual changes from hovering was one). CSS is very good for implementing any of these, and HTML wasa good base. There is a small amount of code that is commented out that could be used in a future expanded version. The layout HTML file is also separate from the index.html page as a way to make adding additional pages easier for the future.
